Executive Summary <br>
For years we have heard politicians emphasize their desire to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.  My experience, however, is that there are a lot of manufacturing jobs available in the U.S., and manufacturers have found it increasingly difficult to find a quality labor force that is interested in working in heavy/light industrial/warehouse/distribution center jobs (e.g., "blue collar" jobs).   

The data questions to be addressed are: 
  1) Review manufacturing employment trends over the last twenty years and identify gaps in openings/fills
  2) Scan job postings for blue collar roles to identify what actions employers are taking, if any, to attract this labor force

Results <br>
A review of sample blue collar job postings - specifically, the job descriptions, found that 19% of the postings included a keyword (e.g., 'bonus', 'pay increase', 'incentive', 'no experience necessary', 'immediately') that can be construed to attract this workforce.
